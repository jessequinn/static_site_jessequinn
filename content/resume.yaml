      summary: "The concept of an organic thin film transistor was first introduced in the late 1980s and research was directed toward two key merits of performance: field-effect mobility and current ON/OFF ratio. Today these two key merits of performance are still highly sought after; however, a shortcoming associated with most organic semiconductors is their susceptibility to chemical interactions and photo-excitation; to name but a few of their caveats. Consequently, the development of organic semiconductors with high charge carrier transport as well as good air stability is still desired. Nature provides a vast diversity of materials and looking for natural or nature inspired semiconductors appears to be a promising route towards interesting and pertinent materials."

      summary: "Both reduced zirconocene (\"Cp2Zr\") and zero valent lithium are known to induce coupling of alkynes to form dimers, oligmers, and polymers. Established work from Fagan et al., Tilley et al., and Eisch et al. was used as the basis for the synthesis of desired targets. First, the attempted syntheses of novel Group IV metalloles from a zirconocene intermediate were studied. There was no conclusive data to state that 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylzirconacyclopentadiene will undergo metallacycle transfer with CrCl3 and FeCl3. The presence of zirconocene dichloride suggests that metallacycle transfer may have occurred, which warrants further investigation. Monomers, 1-bromo-4-hex-1-ynyl-benzene, 1-bromo-3-(phenylethynyl)benzene, and p-dihex-1-ynylbenzene, were synthesized successfully via Sonogashira coupling. Attempts to synthesize novel monomers via lithium and \"Cp2Zr\" had mixed results. 1H NMR acquisition of the hydrolyzed product from zirconocene-coupling of 1-bromo-3-(phenylethynyl)benzene appeared to be successful. Lastly, lithium and \"Cp2Zr\" induced polymerization of novel monomers and known monomers were attempted. Metallacycle transfer from the zirconocene intermediate polymers to thiophene, thiopheneoxide, thiophenedioxide, and phosphole were attempted. However, limited characterization was completed. 1H NMR acquisitions suggest polymer by the loss of resolution and broadening of resonance signals, but further characterization via GPC is required. Monomers, and polymers were characterized using various means such as 1H, 13C, 31P, 119Sn NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, AIMS AccuTOF-DART mass spectrometry and GPC."

      summary: "This thesis reviews the steps required to work towards the synthesis of metal-containing inverse crown macrocycles based on zirconocene-coupling of diynes. Particular focus was on developing a new diyne precursor, 1,4-bis(hexynyldimethylsilyl)benzene, which could potentially promote inverse crown formation during macrocyclization of the polymer and/or during metallacycle transfers. Moreover, the new diyne offers other benefits such as increased safety, and the use of readily available and lower-cost reagents over the original diyne precursor, 1,4-bis(propynyldimethylsilyl)benzene, which Tilley et al. reported using. The newly synthesized diyne 1,4-bis(hexynyldimethylsilyl)benzene was discussed and compared to 1,4- bis(propynyldimethylsilyl)benzene. Subsequent developments were to establish a new route to new main group 13 metalloles, such as gallole and aluminole, via stannole intermediates. Work based on Eisch et al., and Fagan et al. were utilized as a basis to develop a new route to new main group 13 metalloles. Results show that the proposed route in this thesis is a potential route to developing new main group 13 metalloles. Aliquots of stannole solutions treated with either aluminum trichloride or gallium trichloride were discussed and compared."
